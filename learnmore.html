          <h3>Three Prongs</h3>
          <p> HealthSage began as a way to combat frustration with the way consumers are currently asked to make health insurance plan decisions. In our minds, there are three main decision points:

          <ul><b>Geography</b> - what providers (doctors, hospitals, practices, specialists, etc.) are covered under this plan?</ul>
          <ul><b>Procedures</b> - what services (surgeries, procedures, prescriptions, therapies, hospitalizations, etc.) are covered under this plan?</ul  >
          <ul><b>Finances</b> - how much will this plan cost?</ul>

          <p>Geography and Procedures can be difficult pieces of information to come across. However, they are obtainable - plans are required to offer a summary of benefits, as well as a full explanation of the plan's coverage. A call to your doctor or specialist can confirm whether they take a particular health insurance plan provider. It's not easy, but it's doable.</p>

          <h3>Costs</h3>
          <p>But, in our experience, the Finances question has proved impossible to intuit.</p>

          <p>Even if you educate yourself about the moving parts of a plan, comparing the deductible of Plan A versus the deductible of Plan B only gives you a small part of the picture. If you make your decision based only off of a few pieces of information, you're simply guessing - and guessing by comparing apples and oranges. First, you need to know how all of the parts fit together. Secondly, you need to predict which of those parts you will utilize, and when. By only comparing certain aspects without knowing how they interface with one another, you are setting yourself up to be tossed by the winds of your plan usage and it's costs.</p>

          <p>Sadly, many of us throw up our hands in confusion and disgust about how difficult this decision is, and make a choice based off a rationalization. We choose the plan with the cheapest premium, or we choose the plan that has the logo we like the most. Valiantly, some of us go about comparing plans the best we can, and make our choice off an educated guess, hoping for the best.</p>

          <p>Like we said - impossible to intuit. That's why we created HealthSage.</p>

          <h3>It Shouldn't Have To Be This Hard</h3>
          <p>Why is it that such an important decision should be so difficult - so confusing and deadline-driving that we would throw up our hands instead of conquering the decision with informed choices?</p>

          <p>HealthSage isn't for everybody. It's only for people that want to maximize their health insurance plan. It's only for people who want to be as efficient as possible in their health insurance spending. It's only for people who like to know where their money is going, and save it from being blown by others if they can help it. It's only for people who want to cut through the confusion and use smart decision-making tools so they can go on to doing more important things.</p>

          <p>If you're the type of person who likes to make informed choices when it comes to the big decisions, HealthSage is for you.</p>

          <p>It shouldn't have to be this hard, and now, it isn't.</p>

          <h3>Making Predictions</h3>
          <p>The most confusing part about all three of these decision points is that you're making them for a future period of time. Employers usually offer open enrollment in November or December to allow employees to choose a plan that begins January 1st of the upcoming calendar year. <a href="https://healthcare.gov" target="_blank">Healthcare.gov</a> only offers a few select times during the year to enroll. A qualifying event such as a the transition to a new job, a birth, or a death, aren't usually times when you'd like to consider how to compare prescription coverages.</p>

          <p>HealthSage's algorithm allows you to predict how a number of insurance usage outcomes will end up working for you financially. Our system accounts mathematically for how all of the various components (premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, etc.) work together. After your information has populated our system, you can use The Slider to dial in an estimate of your upcoming yearly costs and see, in actuality, which plans are going to work for you, and which are going to end up costing you. Test out different scenarios - the choice you make for your family of six with an injury-prone 10-year old may not be the one you'd make if you're a healthy 23-year old? The page results change dynamically as you interact with the information, helping you can make the best decision for your situation with the most robust information that's ever been available. Because it's not possible to know what your health care providers will bill for various services, we can't offer ironclad predictions for your upcoming year, but we can promise that our algorithm is far more sophisticated than whatever way you've previously made plan decisions.</p>

          <h3>Health Insurance Plan Decisions Made Easy</h3>
          <p>We built this system for ourselves because we were tired of the frustration and confusion. And now we'd like to share it with you. We know that it's not in the interest of insurnace companies to make it any clearer for you. We can't fix the health care industry for you, but we can empower you to make one aspect of your involvement an informed choice, and to make that choice as clear as possible.</p>

          <p>Let the Sage be your guide.</p>
